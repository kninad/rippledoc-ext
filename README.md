# rippledoc-ext
Modifying [rippledoc](http://www.unexpected-vortices.com/sw/rippledoc/index.html) for personal use. 
Rippledoc is a useful utility to render a folder full of markdown files to html counterparts. I sourced
the code for rippledoc from its GitLab [repository](https://gitlab.com/uvtc/rippledoc).

- Preserves Links
- Default css theme is nice!
- Produces table of contents (toc) which is useful for documentation and wiki-like notes.
- Free to modify and change according to our own needs.
