# v2018-08-15

  * Instead of using heuristics, added `--readme-is-index` option.
  * Updated docs. Removed index.md, using ../README.md instead.
  * Made prev/next links spread out across nav header and footer.
  * Minor styling updates.

# v2018-08-11

  * If there's no index.md, but there's a ../README.md, use that
    README as an index.md.
  * Updated Rippledoc's docs to reflect that change, plus a few
    more minor improvements.

    also allowed removing clutter from the header/footer nav bars.

  * Rippledoc rewritten in Python. Started new changelog.
  * moved from GitHub to GitLab
  * removed old side nav pane
