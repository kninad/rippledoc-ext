Prerequisites
=============

Rippledoc requires Python v3.6+.  You'll also need to have a fairly
recent version of [Pandoc](http://pandoc.org/) installed. Instructions
for installing Pandoc are on its website.


Download and Install
====================

To install Rippledoc, download and save [the latest rippledoc.py
file](https://gitlab.com/uvtc/rippledoc/raw/master/rippledoc.py) to
somewhere in your $PATH (such as `~/bin` or `/usr/local/bin`) and make
sure it's is executable (`chmod +x rippledoc.py`).
